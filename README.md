A passion project aimed towards programming and learning python , raspberry pi and hardware management :)

My first project . and i feel its a bit too ambitious (haha) . But after sinking over 100 SGD into this . It gives me the motivation not to give up and accept a nagging from my parents

So ? What is this project about ?

After another session of mindless doomscrolling on tiktok , i stumbled upon a SG content creator who successfully managed to create his own electronic display attached to his wall that
constantly refreshes and displays the bus timing . Upon seeing this amazing project, i thought "huh, cool i guess" and proceeded on with my doomscrolling and dopamine fueled addiction 
for the day. And i thought that would be the end of it . But it kept lingering in the back of my mind for the next week and then i decided . Enough is enough , its time to turn this
passion of mine into a reality . With the help of my ChatGPT Premium Subscription paired with my low self esteem , i was ready to embark on this torture that will lower it even more.

How does this work ?
Raspberry Pi makes an API call → Retrieves JSON data → Processes data in Python → Displays bus timings on the E-Ink display.

Simple enough right ? (NOT FOR ME)
